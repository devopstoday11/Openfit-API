For states imposing sales or use taxes, your purchase is subject to use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. Your purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over the Internet or by other remote means, or because a seller is not required to collect tax. Many states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return at the end of the year reporting all of the taxable purchases that were not taxed and to pay tax on those purchases. Details of how to file these returns may be found at the websites of your respective taxing authorities.","subtotal_before_discount_in_cents":5900,"subtotal_in_cents":5900,"discount_in_cents":0,"terms_and_conditions":""},"metadata":{"discounted_amount":0}}
